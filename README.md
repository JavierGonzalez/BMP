# The Bitcoin Mining Parliament

BMP IS AN OPENSOURCE TOOL WITH NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACTIONS TAKEN BY THIRD PARTIES

## Why

Extract from [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) (2008-10):

> They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of
valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.


Extract from [Miners are the executive power of Bitcoin](https://virtualpol.com/Miners_are_the_executive_power_of_Bitcoin_EN.pdf) (2017-10-31):

> As a new form of executive power, it is likely that in the near future a virtual and transparent
Bitcoin Mining Parliament (BMP) will be established. There each participant can have voice
and vote in proportion to their percentage of demonstrable exahases per second.

Extract from [The Bitcoin Mining Parliament](https://virtualpol.com/BMP_EN.pdf) (2018-06-15):

> Currently, the Bitcoin miners estimate consensus with inadequate coordination.

> This causes contentious hardforks that divide the blockchain, fracture the community, create
confusion and damage adoption. Miners can take responsibility, better than anyone else, for
preventing the risk of such events happening again.

> In the process of technological development, often crossroads arise with two valid but
incompatible solutions in the same blockchain. Therefore, technological development
requires decision-making.

> The human tendency to become entangled in conflict is a predictable pattern. With multiple
development teams competing, confrontation is only a matter of time. To resolve this, miners
must assume their executive role.

> Moreover, in a technological race, the acceleration vector is a decisive factor that makes the
difference. Global adoption will be conquered by the blockchain capable of evolving
technologically at a faster rate.

> For a successful global adoption to be possible, Bitcoin miners must coordinate effectively.

## How

Voting with hashpower.

Bitcoin is the safest voting system known to mankind.

BMP is a LAMP system (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP) completely on-chain.

BMP connects to a Bitcoin Cash client by RPC, to read blocks and transactions. 

The on-chain information is transformed with PHP in 3 tables: blocks, miners and actions.

Actions are created and issued in JavaScript with the Trezor API.
