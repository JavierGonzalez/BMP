## Summary

Bitcoin Cash Node should support the BMP protocol for communication and decision making for BCH development.


## Proposal

It is proposed that Bitcoin Cash Node take the following steps to join other implementations in signaling support for and participating in BMP. Knuth already supports BMP and it is important that miners see support of BMP by BU and BCHN to make BMP a success.

1. Launch an independent BMP node under the Bitcoin Cash Node domain (bmp.bitcoincashnode.org).
2. Make an initial participation in BMP chat with some HP by mining on P2Pool.
3. Maintain a public list of addresses for protocol devs who want to participate and the organisation as a whole.

Note: participation in BMP might require some rented hashpower because it is required that an address BCHN controls is inside a coinbase output in the last 4032 blocks of BCH.


## Motivation and Benefits

Centralized decision making on the blockchain protocol is a problem that has caused in the last years 3 splits (not counting minor cases and NextChain).

We can repeat the same mistake indefinitely, with successive internal disputes in each controversy, until we fail due to atomization (losing marketcap, talent and adoption).

Or we can use now, at a new level, the fundamental mechanism consensus designed by Satoshi Nakamoto based on hashpower voting.

And with the BMP we can achieve that without causing another split (division of people, talent, market cap and adoption)It is only necessary to say YES to the following question: Can we accept a decision made by a majority of hashpower?


## Budget

Undetermined. The amount is dependent on if hashpower needs to be rented, how much hashpower needs to be rented, and for how long.
